# How to Contribute

I especially want to help first-time contributors to open source and/or elixir contribute to this project.

1. Search for an existing issue that may have the answers you need.
2. Create an issue to collaborate with the maintainers on the problem.
3. Create an MR and schedule it for a release with the maintainers.

Alternatively, just create a PR! They are always welcome ðŸ¤—

## Motivation & Principles; Explained

1. **Provide FANTASTIC documentation**: Provide just the right amount of documentation for developers to find what they need.
2. **Full plaid API coverage**: Do our best to keep pairity with the production Plaid API.
3. **Use the plaid API versioning plan**: Maintain a version of this library that matches each supported version of the plaid API.
4. **Return well-defined structs, always**: Structs are a form of documentation, they make it easier for developers to work with responses. Always return them.
